README for Assignment 3: Communication Between Towers

Who am I?

	This program was written by Gunther Wallach for Data Structures - CSCI 2270.
	I am in section 310 and my Instructor is Godley.
	My files are: "CommunicationNetwork.cpp" & "Assignment3.cpp.

Files within this submission:

CommunicationNetwork.cpp

	This file has the implementations of all the seperate functions used by the main function, stored in Assingment3.cpp.

Assignment3.cpp:

	This file includes the main function for the program. The program displays a menu, and asks the user to choose what they want to do, by entering a number associated with the part of the menu you want to do. If the menu selection is not self-explanatory, it will prompt you for an input. The program has the purpose of creating and editing a network of cities, and then sending messages from one city to another. 



README3.txt:

	This text file, the one you are currently reading from, serves the purpose provinding information about who I am, as well as information on how my program works, and how to compile and run the program.

How to Use:

	The code can be compiled using any c++11 compiler. Reach the directory of files, and compile by typing: "g++ -std=c++11 CommunicationNetwork.cpp Assignment3.cpp -o Assignment3". This will make the program executable. 

Run the program in this format:

	./Assingment3 input.txt

	The first input is the name of the executable program. 
	The second input is text file you would like the program to read word for word, and transfer every individual word through the network of citys, and then back again.
